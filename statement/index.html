        <p>My series, Feigned Composure, is a manifestation of mild emotional detachment, which
          is a defense mechanism used to avoid and hide feelings. I use interwoven triangles rendered in
          different marks to cover the plane and, sometimes, conceal what’s beneath. The pattern
          represents dualism. While creating the design, I either experience discomfort due to the work’s
          time-consuming nature, or I feel nothing because it regulates unwanted emotions. However, the
          viewer witnesses none of this and, instead, sees pieces that seem “dreamlike” and “calm.”</p>
        <p>This pattern began nine years ago when I entered high school. I chose to hide words in an
          open-ended project by drawing and cutting out curved lines then transferring them to black paper
          which I glued to a white background. My art teacher compared the shapes to folds in a tablecloth
          which a fictional woman she had read about saw sentences in. Later, I stripped the design of its
          letters and adapted the curves into triangles, which led to gradients that I used to obscure the
          queen of chess in a drawing for my grandfather. The pattern then took on fixed contours that
          contained colors—at one point being compared to cathedral windows—then eventually lost its
          outlines and returned to shading. At that stage, it began to resemble plants and broken glass.</p>
        <p>Since then, I’ve found myself pushing the design, looking for its limitations through
          different mediums and styles.</p>
